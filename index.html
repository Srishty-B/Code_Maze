	<p><b>Theme :</b><br>
My game “Code Maze” is space themed ,where the player is playing the role of a character,<br> who is stuck on a strange planet and needs to figure his way out.<br>



		<b>Elevator Pitch : </b><br>
A 3D Role Playing Game where the player is stuck on a strange planet full of mazes,<br> to get out of the maze, they have to find missing pieces of a code <br>that can help repair their spaceship. They will also need to avoid <br> some aliens roaming inside the maze and find their way out in a specific time limit.<br>



		<b>Project Description :</b><br> 

The project focuses on making a game that includes almost all aspects possible in Game Development.<br> Since this is my first game, I wanted to keep it simple for the time being,<br>so that I can include all the basic concepts in game development,<br> for example : collision handling, scene management, UI components, Raycasting, Instantiation etc.<br> I plan on including high level things later , as I learn progressively and gain some experience.<br> The Game is 3D , single player ,with two working levels.<br>
The Game is easy to understand and play.<br> It’s a simple maze puzzle game where the player needs to find missing things in a maze <br>and find their way out in a time limit, as the level increases,<br> the size and difficulty of maze increases, the player also needs to destroy some aliens<br> and dodge them whenever possible.<br> </p>
