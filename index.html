	<p>Theme :
My game “Code Maze” is space themed ,where the player is playing the role of a character, who is stuck on a strange planet and needs to figure his way out .



Elevator Pitch : 
A 3D Role Playing Game where the player is stuck on a strange planet full of mazes, to get out of the maze, they have to find missing pieces of a code that can help repair their spaceship. They will also need to avoid  some aliens roaming inside the maze and find their way out in a specific time limit.



Project Description : 

The project focuses on making a game that includes almost all aspects possible in Game Development. Since this is my first game, I wanted to keep it simple for the time being ,so that I can include all the basic concepts in game development , for example : collision handling, scene management, UI components, Raycasting, Instantiation etc. I plan on including high level things later , as I learn progressively and gain some experience. The Game is 3D , single player ,with two working levels.
The Game is easy to understand and play. It’s a simple maze puzzle game where the player needs to find missing things in a maze and find their way out in a time limit, as the level increases, the size and difficulty of maze increases, the player also needs to destroy some aliens and dodge them whenever possible. </p>
