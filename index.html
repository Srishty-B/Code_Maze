		<b>Elevator Pitch : </b><br>
<p>A 3D Role Playing Game where the player is stuck on a strange planet full of mazes,to get out of the maze, they have to find missing pieces of a code that can help repair their spaceship. They will also need to avoid some aliens roaming inside the maze and find their way out in a specific time limit.</p><br>

		<b>Project Description :</b><br> 

<p>The project focuses on making a game that includes almost all aspects possible in Game Development.Since this is my first game, I wanted to keep it simple for the time being,so that I can include all the basic concepts in game development,for example : collision handling, scene management, UI components, Raycasting, Instantiation etc. I plan on including high level things later , as I learn progressively and gain some experience.The Game is 3D , single player ,with two working levels.
The Game is easy to understand and play.It’s a simple maze puzzle game where the player needs to find missing things in a maze and find their way out in a time limit, as the level increases,the size and difficulty of maze increases, the player also needs to destroy some aliens and dodge them whenever possible.</p><br>
